# 🌐 Laravel Implementation of Informea API - UNEP Corporate Services Division (2022)

Hello, Laravel enthusiasts and API lovers! 🚀

Welcome to the repository for the Laravel implementation of the Informea API. This project represents a significant enhancement of the original open-source Informea API, redeveloped in PHP during my internship with the UNEP Corporate Services Division in 2022. The goal was to integrate the Informea API into a Laravel application to streamline data retrieval and integration with Azure Data Lake.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In 2022, I had the opportunity to enhance the Informea API by integrating it into a Laravel framework. This implementation aimed to leverage Laravel’s robust features for creating a more scalable and maintainable API solution. The enhanced API now efficiently retrieves documents and data, integrates seamlessly with Azure Data Lake, and provides the BI and Science Division teams with powerful tools for their data analysis needs.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Laravel Integration:**
  - Utilized Laravel’s powerful features to build and manage the API.
  - Improved routing, middleware, and service integration.

- **Enhanced Data Retrieval:**
  - Optimized methods for querying and fetching documents and data.
  - Added caching and optimization for faster and more reliable data access.

- **Azure Data Lake Integration:**
  - Seamless integration for uploading and managing data in Azure Data Lake.
  - Ensured data is stored securely and made accessible for advanced analytics.

- **Robust Documentation & Usability:**
  - Comprehensive API documentation using Laravel’s built-in tools.
  - Clear instructions and examples to guide developers in using and extending the API.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Laravel:**
  - The PHP framework used for developing and managing the API.
  
- **Azure Data Lake:**
  - For storing and managing large volumes of data retrieved from the API.
  
- **Informea API:**
  - The original open-source API that was integrated into Laravel.

- **Additional Tools:**
  - **Laravel Eloquent:** For ORM and database interactions.
  - **Laravel Passport:** For API authentication and security.
  - **Laravel Queue:** For handling background tasks and data processing.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Data Retrieval:**
   - The Laravel implementation enhances the API’s ability to query and retrieve documents and data from Informea. This includes optimized search functionalities and efficient data extraction.

2. **Data Transformation:**
   - Retrieved data is processed and formatted to meet the requirements for integration with Azure Data Lake. This step involves cleaning, normalizing, and enriching the data.

3. **Loading to Azure Data Lake:**
   - The processed data is uploaded to Azure Data Lake, ensuring secure storage and accessibility for the BI and Science Division teams.

4. **API Access & Utilization:**
   - The API provides endpoints for accessing and managing data. Laravel’s routing and middleware handle requests and responses, making it easy for teams to interact with the data.

## 🚀 How to Dive In

- **Explore the Code:**
  - Review the Laravel codebase to understand the implementation and enhancements made to the Informea API.

- **Understand the Workflow:**
  - Check out the data flow from retrieval to storage in Azure Data Lake and how Laravel handles each step.

- **Setup & Configuration:**
  - Follow the instructions in the `config` directory to set up API keys, database connections, and Azure Data Lake credentials.

- **Testing & Development:**
  - Use Laravel’s built-in tools and provided test cases to ensure the API’s functionality and performance.

- **Contribute:**
  - Contributions are welcome! Fork the repository, submit pull requests, or open issues to improve or adapt the API.
